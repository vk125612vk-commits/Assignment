        "\n",
        "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "It’s called “non-parametric” because it doesn’t make assumptions about the underlying data distribution and is known as a lazy learner because it does not build a model during training — instead it stores the training data and waits until you ask it to make a prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, KNN works like this:\n",
        "For any new data point you want to predict, KNN finds the K closest points (neighbors) from its training data and uses them to decide the prediction.\n",

        "\n",
        "Key point: You usually choose an odd value of K (like 3, 5, 7) to reduce ties in voting.\n",
        "\n",
        "📈 KNN for Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "For regression, KNN predicts a continuous value rather than a class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   After finding the K nearest neighbors, KNN averages their target values (the output variable) to make the prediction.\n",
