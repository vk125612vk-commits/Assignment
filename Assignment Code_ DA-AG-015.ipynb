It works by training models one after another, where each step identifies hard-to-classify examples, making the combined model highly accurate at complex pattern recognition, unlike bagging which trains models in parallel.\n","\n","\n","**How Boosting Improves Weak Learners**\n","\n","1> Sequential Learning & Error Correction: Instead of training models independently, boosting builds them sequentially. Each new weak learner (e.g., a decision stump) is trained to specifically address the mistakes of the ensemble's current performance.\n","\n","\n","2> Weight Adjustment: After a model is trained, the algorithm re-weights the training data. Misclassified instances get higher weights, making them \"harder\" examples that the next model must focus on.\n","\n","3> Focus on Difficult Samples: By assigning higher weights to errors, subsequent models are forced to pay more attention to complex patterns or noisy data points that were previously misclassified, improving overall precision.\n","\n","4> Bias Reduction: This iterative focusing process gradually reduces the bias of the ensemble, transforming slightly better-than-random models into a highly accurate, robust predictor.\n","\n","\n","5> Weighted Combination: The final strong model combines the predictions of all weak learners, often using weighted voting, where better-\n","performing learners have a greater say in the final output.\n","\n","\n","**Key Algorithms**\n","\n","1 AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting): Adjusts instance weights directly.\n","\n","2 Gradient Boosting: Trains models to predict the residuals (errors) of the previous model, optimizing the loss function.\n","\n","3 XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost: Advanced, efficient gradient boosting implementations.\n","\n","By iteratively focusing on mistakes, boosting effectively turns a collection of simple, low-performing models into a sophisticated and highly accurate predictive system, making it a cornerstone of modern machine learning."],"metadata":{"id":"Uv1OIz5SglNu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Question 2: What is the difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting in terms of how models are trained?"],"metadata":{"id":"LtaGPGLUoCan"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Answer\n","\n","AdaBoost focuses on misclassified points by increasing their weights, training simple \"stump\" models sequentially to correct these harder samples, while Gradient Boosting fits new models to the residual errors (gradients) of the overall loss function, using a learning rate and often deeper trees, aiming to minimize a differentiable loss function directly.
